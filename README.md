### About Me 🚀
🎓 I’m a Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience, currently pursuing my **Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science** at **Purdue University Fort Wayne**.  
👩‍💻 I’m deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and I love crafting smart solutions that blend technology with real-world value.  
🌱 Always learning, always building — I thrive on staying curious and working on problems that challenge me technically and creatively.  



### My Experiences 💼

- **Machine Learning Research Consultant** @ [Rivach LLP](https://www.rivach.com)  
  Designed and developed machine learning (ML) pipelines for recommendation systems and computer vision modules. Worked closely with full-stack developers to deploy models into production and enhance real-time decision-making in digital products. Delivered customized solutions to client-specific use cases, including user behavior-based content personalization and image recognition for inventory monitoring.

- **Software Development Engineer Intern** @ **Amazon**  
  Contributed to Amazon Seller Central by building a feature that allows sellers to manage their schedules via calendar integration. Developed serverless applications using AWS services such as **SQS**, **S3**, **SNS**, **SES**, and **Lambda**. Ensured seamless email-to-calendar sync, increased user efficiency, and reduced support tickets by automating key workflows for over 15,000 users.

- **Machine Learning Research Intern** @ [Centella Scientific](https://www.centella.co.in)  
  Focused on ML-based drug discovery, working on virtual screening and ADMET prediction using deep learning. Built and trained classification and regression models to identify promising compounds, and automated the pipeline using the KNIME platform for scalability. Streamlined workflows helped accelerate compound evaluation for research teams.

- **Student Mentor** @ **Advanced Academic Center, GRIET**  
  Mentored students in core machine learning concepts, helping them develop mini-projects in Python using libraries like **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**. Conducted workshops and guided students through paper publishing processes and internship applications.


### 🚀 Projects & Publications

- **Raspberry Pi-based Embedded Vision Module**  
  Aids visually impaired by detecting objects and obstacles in real time using YOLOv3 and RVNet.

- **Text Summarization using NLP**  
  Employed extractive summarization to generate concise abstracts from lengthy text sources.

- **Enhanced Demand Forecasting System** (published in IEEE)  
  Utilized XGBoost and Random Forest ensemble methods to forecast food raw materials and optimize resource allocation.
