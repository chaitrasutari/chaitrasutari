### About Me 🚀
🎓 I’m a Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience, currently pursuing my **Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science** at **Purdue University Fort Wayne**.  
👩‍💻 I’m deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and I love crafting smart solutions that blend technology with real-world value.  
🌱 Always learning, always building — I thrive on staying curious and working on problems that challenge me technically and creatively.  



### My Experiences 💼

- **Machine Learning Research Consultant** @ [Rivach LLP](https://www.rivach.com)  
  Designed and developed machine learning (ML) pipelines for recommendation systems and computer vision modules. Worked closely with full-stack developers to deploy models into production and enhance real-time decision-making in digital products. Delivered customized solutions to client-specific use cases, including user behavior-based content personalization and image recognition for inventory monitoring.

- **Software Development Engineer Intern** @ **Amazon**  
  Contributed to Amazon Seller Central by building a feature that allows sellers to manage their schedules via calendar integration. Developed serverless applications using AWS services such as **SQS**, **S3**, **SNS**, **SES**, and **Lambda**. Ensured seamless email-to-calendar sync, increased user efficiency, and reduced support tickets by automating key workflows for over 15,000 users.

- **Machine Learning Research Intern** @ [Centella Scientific](https://www.centella.co.in)  
  Focused on ML-based drug discovery, working on virtual screening and ADMET prediction using deep learning. Built and trained classification and regression models to identify promising compounds, and automated the pipeline using the KNIME platform for scalability. Streamlined workflows helped accelerate compound evaluation for research teams.

- **Student Mentor** @ **Advanced Academic Center, GRIET**  
  Mentored students in core machine learning concepts, helping them develop mini-projects in Python using libraries like **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**. Conducted workshops and guided students through paper publishing processes and internship applications.


### 🚀 Projects

- **MediCareNet – Predictive Healthcare Insights using ML & MLOps**  
  Built ML pipelines to predict hospital readmissions from EHR datasets using XGBoost (F1 > 75%). Integrated MLflow and DVC for versioning, with Dockerized Flask APIs and GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment on AWS EC2.

- **VisionIQ – Transformer-based Real-Time Object Detection**  
  Designed a real-time object detection system using HuggingFace Transformers and OpenCV. Achieved 90%+ accuracy for live video feeds. Integrated FastAPI REST and WebSocket APIs with a React.js dashboard for spatial analytics. Deployed inference via AWS Lambda for serverless operation.

- **SmartDoc AI – Intelligent Document Summarization & Q&A System**  
  Built an end-to-end NLP pipeline for document ingestion and summarization using AWS Textract and fine-tuned BERT on SQuAD2.0. Integrated vector search (Pinecone, MongoDB) and FastAPI-based APIs to deliver semantic search and question answering over scanned PDFs.

- **Ask My Resume – LLM-Based Resume Q&A Agent**  
  Created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, HuggingFace, and FAISS to enable semantic Q&A over resumes. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud with custom PDF parsing and memory-backed QA chains.

- **Dual‑Stage Toxic Comment Detection System (Final Project – NLP Course)**  
  Developed a two-stage NLP pipeline for classifying toxic online comments. Stage 1 uses a lightweight classifier (e.g., logistic regression) to filter confidently non-toxic text, while Stage 2 applies a deep learning model(DNNs) to handle ambiguous cases. Achieved improved precision-recall balance with reduced inference cost.

- **Raspberry Pi-based Embedded Vision Module** *(Legacy)*  
  A real-time assistive module for visually impaired individuals using YOLOv3 and RVNet to detect objects and obstacles via embedded vision.

- **Text Summarization using NLP** *(Legacy)*  
  Developed an extractive summarization tool for generating concise abstracts from large textual documents.

### 🚀 Publications

- **Enhanced Demand Forecasting System for Food & Raw Materials**  
  Published in IEEE: Developed a stacking ensemble model (XGBoost + Random Forest) to forecast raw material needs, customer inflow, and dish-level sales. Resulted in significant optimization of supply planning.
