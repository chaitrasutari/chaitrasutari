### About Me 🚀
🎓 I’m a Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience, currently pursuing my **Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science** at **Purdue University Fort Wayne**.  
👩‍💻 I’m deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and I love crafting smart solutions that blend technology with real-world value.  
🌱 Always learning, always building — I thrive on staying curious and working on problems that challenge me technically and creatively.  



### My Experiences 💼

- **Graduate Data Science Researcher** @ [The Data Mine, Purdue University](https://datamine.purdue.edu/)  
  - Developed predictive models and ETL pipelines using Python, R, and SQL to forecast claims and analyze policyholder retention, transforming raw multi-year insurance data into structured assets for analysis.
  - Managed the full data science lifecycle within an Agile environment, utilizing machine learning libraries to drive data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual reporting.
  - Translated complex analytical findings into strategic recommendations, presenting executive-ready visualizations and business insights to corporate stakeholders and non-technical audiences.

- **Machine Learning Research Consultant** @ [Rivach LLP](https://www.rivach.com)  
  - Optimized machine learning systems for digital products, focusing on computer vision and recommendation systems, which enhanced accuracy by 25%.
  - Collaborated with developers to integrate models into web applications, ensuring business-focused reporting and usability.
  - Supported predictive modeling projects combining product data and user behavior to optimize offerings.

- **Software Development Engineer Intern** @ **Amazon**  
  - Developed a feature for Amazon Seller Central using Java and AWS services(SQS, S3, Lambda) supporting over 15,000 users.
  - Enabled clients to create and update their schedules via email calendars, increasing user engagement by 30% and reducing customer support requests by 20%.
  - Followed agile practices, which contributed to rapid feature rollout and enhanced system scalability, improving team productivity.

- **Machine Learning Research Intern** @ [Centella Scientific](https://www.centella.co.in)  
  - Developed deep learning models for virtual screening and ADMET prediction to support early-phase drug discovery.
  - Accelerated drug repurposing workflows by 25% through ML-based pharmacokinetic profiling using KNIME pipelines.
  - Explored retrosynthesis prediction with ML and cheminformatics tools to identify viable synthesis routes for candidate compounds

- **Teaching Assistant – Fundamentals of Java Programming (OOPs)** @ **Undergraduate Program, GRIET**  
  - Assisted in teaching core Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
  - Guided students through laboratory exercises and helped debug and optimize their Java code.

- **Student Mentor** @ **Advanced Academic Center, GRIET**  
  - Mentored students in core machine learning concepts, helping them develop projects in Machine learning and Python using libraries like **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**. Conducted workshops and guided students in research and internship applications.
  - Mentored peers in data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
  - Taught algorithmic paradigms such as recursion, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming through problem-solving sessions.
  - Encouraged best coding practices and helped students develop confidence in solving algorithmic challenges.



### 🚀 Projects

- **Influenza Forecasting – Time-Series Analysis (Machine Learning Coursework)**  
  Engineered a time-series model to forecast influenza outbreaks by integrating historical flu surveillance data with meteorological features like temperature and humidity. Built and evaluated an LSTM neural network against traditional baseline models, utilizing rolling-window validation to capture seasonal trends and environmental predictors.

- **Dual‑Stage Toxic Comment Detection System (Natural Language Processing Coursework)**  
  Developed a two-stage NLP pipeline for classifying toxic online comments. Stage 1 uses a lightweight classifier (e.g., logistic regression) to filter confidently non-toxic text, while Stage 2 applies a deep learning model(DNNs) to handle ambiguous cases. Achieved improved precision-recall balance with reduced inference cost.

- **MediCareNet – Predictive Healthcare Insights using ML & MLOps**  
  Built ML pipelines to predict hospital readmissions from EHR datasets using XGBoost (F1 > 75%). Integrated MLflow and DVC for versioning, with Dockerized Flask APIs and GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment on AWS EC2.

- **VisionIQ – Transformer-based Real-Time Object Detection**  
  Designed a real-time object detection system using HuggingFace Transformers and OpenCV. Achieved 90%+ accuracy for live video feeds. Integrated FastAPI REST and WebSocket APIs with a React.js dashboard for spatial analytics. Deployed inference via AWS Lambda for serverless operation.

- **SmartDoc AI – Intelligent Document Summarization & Q&A System**  
  Built an end-to-end NLP pipeline for document ingestion and summarization using AWS Textract and fine-tuned BERT on SQuAD2.0. Integrated vector search (Pinecone, MongoDB) and FastAPI-based APIs to deliver semantic search and question answering over scanned PDFs.

- **Ask My Resume – LLM-Based Resume Q&A Agent**  
  Created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, HuggingFace, and FAISS to enable semantic Q&A over resumes. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud with custom PDF parsing and memory-backed QA chains.

- **Raspberry Pi-based Embedded Vision Module** *(Legacy)*  
  A real-time assistive module for visually impaired individuals using YOLOv3 and RVNet to detect objects and obstacles via embedded vision.

- **Text Summarization using NLP** *(Legacy)*  
  Developed an extractive summarization tool for generating concise abstracts from large textual documents.
